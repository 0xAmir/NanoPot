# NanoPot
An ultra tiny honeypot script written in python.
NanoPot Runs on port 80,8080,22,21,23 and 443
Will add an option to select the ports to listen at from the command line but i'm too sleepy to do it now.
Commands.py contains a set of command to implement inside NanoPot, if you ever feel the need to add more yourself feel free to do so, just don't forget to add it to the "help" command.
Also you can change the type of device it impersonates (Currently it's an Echolife hg8240 router)

## Usage
./NanoPot.py
